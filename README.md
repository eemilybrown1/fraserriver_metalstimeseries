# fraserriver_metalstimeseries

This repository contains data saved from [Canadian Federal-Provincial Monitoring/Fresh Water Quality Monitoring and Surveillance project](https://aquatic.pyr.ec.gc.ca/webdataonlinenational/en/Home?siteCode=BC08MH0453&projectCode=PYLTM&regionId=0) at the [Fraser River at Hope station](https://aquatic.pyr.ec.gc.ca/webdataonlinenational/en/SiteDetails/BC08MF0001/Projects/PYLTM/Regions/0).
At present, data has been reformatted manually in excel before being uploaded into this repository, however I plan to work on a script which will automatically reformat data saved from this database to be suable in R.

The R script is in progress, with the goal to visualize the annual time series of metals in the fraser river. 

The issues tab is used to mark tasks to do.
